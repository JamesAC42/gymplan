**Warm-up (Do this every gym session):**
*   5 min incline walk (get a sweat going).
*   Arm circles & leg swings.
*   1 set of 15 "Face Pulls" (light weight) to wake up rear delts/posture.

**The Lifting Routine (Antagonist Paired Sets)**
*Instructions: Perform A1, rest 0-30s, Perform A2, Rest 90s. Repeat for all sets, then move to B1/B2.*

#### The Cardio Strategy (Cognitive & Heart Health)

Since you are WFH, we need to hack your environment.

1.  **Post-Lift Cardio (M/W/F):** 15 mins Incline Walking immediately after weights. Incline 10-12, Speed 3.0. Do not run. This burns pure fat as glycogen is depleted from lifting.
2.  **The "Cognitive Commute" (T/Th):** Since you don't drive to work, you must "walk to work." Before you log on, go for a 20-30 min brisk walk outside. The morning sunlight sets your circadian rhythm (better sleep) and the movement primes your brain for focus.
3.  **The Step Goal:** Aim for 8,000 steps daily. WFH makes this hard. Pacing during calls is allowed.

#### Nutrition: Low-FODMAP for Fat Loss

**Calorie Target:** 2,000–2,200 kcals
**Protein Target:** 180g (Non-negotiable)

**Meal Prep Strategy (Utilizing the Garage Freezer)**
Since you have a toddler and a wife, do not cook separate "diet meals." Cook bulk proteins and carbs that are plain, and use sauces to differentiate.

**Batch Prep These (Weekend):**
1.  **Protein:** 3-4lbs of Chicken Breast or Thighs. Bake with salt, pepper, and oregano (Low FODMAP safe). Shred it or chop it. Freeze half.
2.  **Carb:** Big batch of white rice or roasted potatoes (olive oil + rosemary).
3.  **Veg:** Frozen bags of green beans or spinach (easy to microwave).

**The "Blueprint" Daily Meal Structure:**

*   **Breakfast (Fast & Cognitive):**
    *   Oatmeal with water/lactose-free milk, scoop of Whey Isolate (check for lactose), blueberries, walnuts.
    *   *Why:* Fast digesting, brain fuel (walnuts), high protein.
*   **Lunch (The Work Bowl):**
    *   6-8oz Prepped Chicken + 1 cup Rice + Handful Spinach.
    *   **The Sauce Hack:** Since you can't have garlic/onion, use **Garlic-Infused Olive Oil** (FODMAP safe) mixed with lemon juice and maple syrup. Or Fody brand BBQ sauce.
*   **Snack (Pre-Gym or Afternoon Slump):**
    *   Rice Cake with Peanut Butter + a Kiwi or Orange.
*   **Dinner (Family Style):**
    *   Ground Beef Tacos. Use a homemade taco seasoning (Cumin, Paprika, Oregano, Chili Powder - *No Garlic/Onion powder*).
    *   Corn tortillas (usually FODMAP safe).
    *   Wife/Son can add cheese, avocado, sour cream. You stick to meat, lettuce, tomato, moderate cheese.

#### Progression: How to ensure "Fast" Results

You are looking for **Progressive Overload**.

1.  **The "Double Progression" Rule:** Pick a weight you can do for the *bottom* of the rep range (e.g., 8 reps).
2.  Keep that weight until you can do 3 sets of the *top* of the rep range (e.g., 10 reps) with perfect form.
3.  Increase the weight by 5-10lbs. Drop back to 8 reps. Repeat.
4.  **Log It:** You must use an app or notebook. If you don't track it, you won't improve fast.

#### Troubleshooting the New Job/WFH Transition

*   **The 2:00 PM Crash:** If you feel sluggish in the afternoon, do **not** drink more coffee (ruins sleep). Do 20 air squats and drink 16oz of cold water.
*   **The "Hybrid" Weeks:** On the days you go into the office (T/T), pack your lunch. If you buy lunch, get a salad with grilled chicken and ask for oil/vinegar on the side. Restaurant dressings are hidden FODMAP bombs (garlic/onion).
*   **Recovery:** If your sleep suffers because of the 2-year-old, drop one set from every exercise that week. Do not skip the gym; just reduce the volume. Consistency beats intensity.
